2️⃣ ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)

Entities & Relationships:

User

id, name, email, password, walletBalance, createdAt

Task / Challenge

id, title, description, points, type, createdAt

Streak_History

id, userId, taskId, date, completed

Reward

id, name, pointsCost, type, expiryDate

Squad / UserSquad

User (1) ----< UserSquad >---- (1) Squad
User (1) ----< Reward (wallet balance redemption)
Streak_Event ---< Streak_History


I can generate a visual ERD diagram as a PNG or SVG for you.

3️⃣ DFD (Data Flow Diagram) – Level 0

Main flows:

User interacts with Mobile App

App calls Backend API

API interacts with Database & Redis

API triggers Challenge Engine for dynamic challenges

API triggers Reward Engine for earning/redeeming coins

Notifications sent via Firebase / Twilio

DFD (text-based):

[User] --> [Mobile App] --> [Backend API] --> [Database (PostgreSQL)]
                                      |--> [Cache (Redis)]
                                      |--> [OpenAI API (Challenge Engine)]
                                      |--> [Payment API (Stripe/Razorpay)]
                                      |--> [Notifications (Firebase/ Twilio)]

✅ Implementation Logic

Streak Calculation:

Daily check for task completion → increment streak → bonus points added for milestones

Store streaks in Redis for fast access

Reward System:

Coins earned per task + streak bonus

Limited-time rewards trigger expiration logic

Squad Mechanism:

Users join squads

Collective streak completion → bonus points distributed

Leaderboard Logic:

Redis cache for fast leaderboard updates

Sort users by total points + streak multiplier

Notifications:

Reminder push notifications for incomplete tasks

Event notifications for limited-time streak events

Analytics Tracking:

Track user actions: task completion, streak updates, reward redemption
